# data-analytics-portfolio - Inna Teterina

This repository serves as a central hub for my Data Analytics / BI portfolio.
It provides an overview of selected projects that demonstrate my experience across the full data lifecycle - from data collection and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and business interpretation.

The projects focus on real-world datasets and practical analytical problems, using tools commonly required for BI and Data Analyst roles.

--- Skills and Tools Demonstrated  ---

Across the projects in this portfolio, I apply the following skills:

- Data gathering (CSV, APIs, web-scraping)
- Data cleaning and validation
- Data preprocessing and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- KPI design and performance analysis (CPA, ROAS, ROI, LTV, retention)
- Reporting and dashboarding
- Business-oriented data interpretation

** Tools and technologies: **

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- Excel / Google Sheets (advanced formulas, pivots, validation)
- Power BI / Tableau / Qlik
- Jupyter Notebooks
- APIs and web-scraping

--- Project Approach ---

Each project follows a structured analytical workflow:

1. Problem definition
2. Data sourcing
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Analysis and visualization
5. Insight generation and interpretation

The emphasis is on clarity, reproducibility, and business relevance rather than overly complex modeling.

--- Notes ---

- All datasets used are publicly available or legally scraped from permitted sources.
- Where full datasets are large, sample data is provided with instructions to reproduce results.
- Dashboards are included as screenshots or public links where applicable.
